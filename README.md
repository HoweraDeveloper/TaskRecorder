# TaskRecorder
_üìù A materialistic Task Recorder, designed for low friction! üìù_
## Motivation
This project is a side-project I developed to enhance my workflow.
In most modern Todo Lists, the unit for recording is the "task", not really the "subject".
For example, if you desired to begin a new task, you would time yourself performing a task, which is counter-intuitive.

Really, the first thing that springs to mind as we begin a task is the subject itself.
That would also be the thing that we write to a task record.
We would not write "08:00 ~ 10:00 | Calculus 1-1 Introduction", yet "08:00 ~ 10:00 | Calculus".
We would then optionally write the portion of the subject that we actually studied, and re-use the subject as we progress throughout the day.

## Features
- Add tasks ("Subjects"), which includes:
  - Task Name
  - Task Tag (Work, Rest, Meal)
- Start timing tasks / end timing.
- Record your subjects.
- Export records into text files and import text files to restore the original records and subjects.
- Records across different days!

## To-do
- Add a multi-line description to the current session.
- Update terminologies used on the page to match the README.
- Recreate the UI (?)
- Add scheduling.

There is obviously more to come, so please stay tuned!
